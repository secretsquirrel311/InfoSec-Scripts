21OCT24: Added a basic python script to run an nmap scan using a target IP address and scan type arguments. Additional functionality is planned to be added into the script. See description on the commit for more info.  

27MAR25: Added a comprehensive NMAP Network Reconaissance script. This script contains 6 Nmap functions for common tasks. The script provides a 'pretty' interface for the user allowing them to select which type of scan they want to execute or exit out. The code itself contains validation for IP addresses, port argument, and IP address with subnet mask. This is a major improvement on my coding skills as I typically do not include any validation. Additionally, I added error handling to each function as well to handle and output an errors during runtime. Overall, definitely improving my coding knowledge and skill. I still used outside resources, but mainly to clean up my code, simplify, or provide better readability. Eventually I will get to the point of not needing outside resources for stuff like this.
